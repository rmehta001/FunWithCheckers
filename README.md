# FunWithCheckers
Implemented a minimax algorithm to look multiple moves ahead. 
It uses iterative deepening, i.e., first look ahead by only one move, then store it as the best move so far, then
start over and look two moves ahead, and overwrite the best move with the new one, and so on. 
If it runs out of time, It return the best move found in the last fully executed minimax procedure. 
Also, I tried to improve the simple GetScore function used by
Alan_Turing.
